## <a name="digital-thoreau-overview"></a> Digital Thoreau Overview

[Digital Thoreau](https://digitalthoreau.org) is a collaborative initiative of the [State University of New York at Geneseo](https://geneseo.edu), [The Thoreau Society](https://thoreausociety.org), and the [Walden Woods Project](https://walden.org). Its mission is to promote public engagement with the writings of Henry David Thoreau.

Currently, the initiative consists of four projects. They are all accessible from the main landing page of [Digital Thoreau](https://digitalthoreau.org).

- [The Readers' Thoreau](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org), a social network for reading Thoreau collaboratively.
- [*Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*](https://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/), an edition of *Walden* that enables readers to track Thoreau's revisions across the seven draft versions he constructed between 1846 and 1854.
- [The *Walden* Manuscript Project](https://digitalthoreau.org/the-walden-manuscript-project/), designed to help readers work with the [digitized manuscript of *Walden*](https://cdm16003.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16003coll16) and understand its significance for the study of Thoreau as a writer and thinker. As part of the project, Digital Thoreau recently published an online version of William Rossi's essay ["Making *Walden* and Its Sandbank,"](https://digitalthoreau.org/making-walden-and-its-sandbank/) which originally appeared in the *Concord Saunterer* vol. 30 n.s. (2022). The online version of the essay enables readers to examine the manuscript pages discussed by Rossi.
- [The Days of Walter Harding, Thoreau Scholar](https://walterharding.org), a student maintained website honoring the life and legacy of Thoreau scholar and SUNY Distinguished Professor Walter Harding.

News and perspectives related to the initiative can be found on the Digital Thoreau [blog](https://digitalthoreau.org/blog/).

## <a name="workshop-overview"></a> Workshop Overview [&#8673;](#contents)

This workshop will introduce you to [The Readers' Thoreau](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org), [*Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*](https://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/), and the [*Walden* Manuscript Project](https://digitalthoreau.org/the-walden-manuscript-project/).

<p style="border:1px solid black;border-radius:15px;background:#deedff;padding:1.5em;max-width: 500px;font-style:italic;"><strong>Note:</strong> You'll get the most out this workshop if you bring a laptop computer.</p>

In the workshop, you'll

- Register an account on [The Readers' Thoreau](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org) (if you haven't done so already), join a private reading group on the site created just for workshop participants, and learn how to use the site to annotate texts by Thoreau and connect with other readers.
- Learn how to use the [fluid-text edition of *Walden*](https://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/) to track Thoreau's revisions to the *Walden* manuscript.
- Learn how to use the [manuscript search tool](https://digitalthoreau.org/manuscript-search-tool/) created as part of the [*Walden* Manuscript Project](https://digitalthoreau.org/the-walden-manuscript-project/) to correlate the transcribed revisions in the fluid-text edition with the digitized manuscript.
- Work in groups to explore selected revisions to *Walden* in both the fluid text and the manuscript.
