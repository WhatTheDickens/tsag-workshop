## <a name="overview"></a> Overview

[Digital Thoreau](https://digitalthoreau.org) is a collaborative initiative of the [State University of New York at Geneseo](https://geneseo.edu), [The Thoreau Society](https://thoreausociety.org), and the [Walden Woods Project](https://walden.org) whose mission is to promote engagement with the writings of Henry David Thoreau.

Currently, the initiative consists of four projects. You can get to all of these projects from the main landing page of [Digital Thoreau](https://digitalthoreau.org).

- [The Readers' Thoreau](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org), a social network for reading Thoreau collaboratively
- [*Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*](https://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/), an edition of *Walden* that enables readers to track Thoreau's revisions across the seven draft versions he constructed between 1846 and 1854
- [The *Walden* Manuscript Project](https://digitalthoreau.org/the-walden-manuscript-project/), designed to help readers work with the [digitized manuscript of *Walden*](https://cdm16003.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16003coll16) and understand its significance for the study of Thoreau as a writer and thinker
- [The Days of Walter Harding, Thoreau Scholar](https://walterharding.org), a student maintained website honoring the life and legacy of Thoreau scholar and SUNY Distinguished Professor Walter Harding
